# Welcome to My Personal Portfolio's Code!

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This is where I brought my digital resume to life with code. I designed it to be more than just a list of my skills and experiences; it's an interactive showcase of my passion for web development and clean design.

Feel free to browse the code to see how it all works!

## ✨ Features You'll See on the Live Site

-   **Interactive Animated Background**: The subtle dot grid background isn't static! It was created with HTML5 Canvas and reacts to your mouse movements.
-   **Dynamic Hero Section**: The first thing you see is my name, which appears with a slick reveal animation and a continuous, gentle "pulse" glow effect.
-   **Smooth Scrolling & Navigation**: The site features a clean header that becomes translucent as you scroll, along with smooth navigation and a fully responsive mobile menu.
-   **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: As you scroll down, content sections gracefully fade and slide into view, making the discovery of information feel more dynamic.
-   **Polaroid-Style "About Me"**: To add a personal touch, I created a tilted polaroid-style photo with a fun hover effect and a handwritten caption.
-   **Clean Timelines**: My work experience and education history are displayed in an elegant and easy-to-read timeline.
-   **Project Showcase**: My projects are displayed in a grid of cards that have a subtle hover effect, revealing links to learn more.
-   **Fully Responsive Design**: The portfolio was built with a mobile-first approach, so it looks and works great on any device, from a small phone to a large desktop monitor.

## 🛠️ Tech Behind the Magic

For those interested in the code, here’s a quick look at the technologies I used to build this site:

-   **React** & **TypeScript** for a modern, component-based, and type-safe structure.
-   **Tailwind CSS** for styling the entire site with a utility-first approach.
-   **HTML5 Canvas** to create the custom, interactive background animation from scratch.
-   **No build step needed!** It's all vanilla JS/TS and runs directly in the browser, keeping things simple and fast.

Thanks for stopping by!
